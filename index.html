                People say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As the beholder, 
                I found truth when I became struck to the beauty I witnessed, you. 
                It's almost been a year ever since we started talking and so many 
                seasons have passed, yet I still feel that time halts in every 
                amazement of you.

                The beauty of your soul left me rendered speechless 
                along with your genuine emotions, your kindness, and most especially… 
                your faith in the most loving Father. The way you convey the fire of 
                your faith is an inspiration to me and many others. You are one of a kind.

                You have encouraged me more than you think. More than I originally thought, honestly. 
                Our almost-a-year of devotions has been a big part of me this past year and I want to 
                thank you for being part of my journey of being closer to Him.

                There are so many more devotions we’ll encounter together and I am sure that as you sink deeper 
                in your faith, God will move in ways you have never imagined. Same goes for me, of course. 
                Cheers to more consistent weeks!

                As you fulfil every role that life brings, I want to remind you to take everything as slow 
                as you need it to be. You don’t have to cope with the speed of everything revolving around 
                you, you are free to take your time. Take it one step at a time and you’ll find that indeed, 
                being slow does not equate to being last.

                Truly it is all thanks to Him that you have successfully entered my life. My heart, even. 
                I believe it was God who led us to this very moment and made our paths intertwine so that we 
                can help each other grow not just at surface level but for a well-rooted foundation of faith 
                as we pursue Him.

                I really thank God for you. You became my place of safety, a non-judgmental (maybe) listener, 
                my partner in faith and prayer, what more can I ask for? As I prayed for that special partner, 
                I found that my prayer has already been answered.

                He will always be my number one priority whatever the odds. And it goes without saying, I know 
                I won’t be the first as well, as it should be.

                I can never be perfect but I can be the most suitable and as He prepares me, may the Lord also 
                prepare you to the most perfect version of yourself. It is in my heart and prayers for everything 
                to work as God intends. It can be quite overwhelming and I know you want to be fully ready first.

                to be patient and to allow myself to be led by the Holy Spirit. You can rest assured that as the time 
                you prepare yourself, I will be right there in the waiting as your cheerleader cheering you on. 
                I will willingly wait for you.
