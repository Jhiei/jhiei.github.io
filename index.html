                It's truly so difficult to believe that we have made it
                this far. If you think about it, our story began with a
                simple scenery but it turned out to be the beginning of
                a God-filled friendship. Isn't it just too good to be true?

                Throughout the journey, we encountered many challenges
                that brought spiritual growth to us. We bravely battled
                through prayers, through faith and trust that God will
                carry us through it. We have become such a better version
                of ourselves and I want to thank God for you. Your life
                was used in mine to become a great encouragement. You
                became my supportive partner in this journey. He made our 
                fates intertwine and placed us right where we needed to be.
                Meeting you is one of my greatest blessing.

                I cannot deny how enchanting it was to meet you. I'm wonderstruck
                to the beauty you have displayed. Most especially the way you glorify 
                Him with your faith, it is an art to be admired. It is not simply your
                appearance that makes you beautiful, it is your kind soul that
                treats those around you with genuine care and inspiring words. You
                are sincerely one of a kind.

                Meeting you was enchanting enough but having you until the end of the road
                is a surreal blessing from above. This does not mark the end of our journey 
                but we are simply opening a new chapter. There are so many more devotions 
                and leadings of the Holy Spirit that we will encounter together and I am sure 
                that as we both sink deeper in our faith through His grace, He will move in 
                ways we have never imagined.
